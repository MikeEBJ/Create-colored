# Create: Colored (Updated) - ![Create: Colored (Updated) Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/v/create-colored-(updated))

As stated by the [original mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-colored), Create: Colored aims to add variants to various blocks in create.

This fork also adds a few QOL fixes and support for Create 6.0.8.


# All Features
As a quick run-down, this mod simply adds
- Colored Pipes
- Colored Tanks
   - Colored Boiler Gauge

Colored blocks will not connect to other colored blocks, unless they are strictly forced to. This allows you to have setups where a colored pipe runs next to another colored tank and they don't connect.
